the journal behaviour has its roots in ethology and behavioural biology (see historical note), in which the emphasis is not so much on how animals compare with humans under strictly controlled conditions (as in comparative psychology), but more on tracing the phylogeny and evolution of natural behaviour as shown under naturalistic or natural conditions. specialized cognition and communication are part of this approach. well-controlled laboratory experiments are needed and welcome, but by no means the only approach. behaviour has a long tradition of publishing systematic observations of spontaneous behaviour. 

behaviour covers the whole animal kingdom, from invertebrates to fish, and from frogs to primates. the study of animal behaviour remains vibrant and keeps attracting young, talented scientists, who will find behaviour a journal with a quick turn-around time (we strive for first reviews within a month) read by a wide range of students and researchers of animal behaviour."

since it exceeds the means of researchers from individual scientific disciplines to investigate the simultaneous biopsychosocial changes of systems and how they jointly contribute to the social and adaptive functions of human individuals, a new scientific approach is necessary that links the various traditional scientific disciplines under a biopsychosocial approach to describe individual human development: developmental science.

developmental science combines concepts and insights from scientific disciplines which hitherto used to independently tackle the research of human and non-human development. as an interdisciplinary approach it examines individuals across the lifespan with the objective of comprehending the development of individuals with different cultural and ethnic as well as biological background, different economic and cognitive potentials and under diverse living conditions. to facilitate the understanding of developmental processes it is also necessary to overcome the disadvantageous separation of “normal” from “abnormal” human development. thus, the interdisciplinary field of developmental science comprises a holistic approach to understanding how different systems interact and influence development throughout life from genetic and physiological processes to social interactions and cultural processes."

many assume a dualistic relationship between reality and constructed elements. they maintain that constructed mental structures gradually adapt to the structures of the real world (e.g., piaget). in this view perception is the pickup of information controlled by the mental structure that is constructed from earlier perceptions (e.g., neisser). this leads to the claim that mental structures are about learning sensorimotor contingencies (e.g., o’regan).

others seek to avoid the dualistic position. either they skeptically reject that the structures of the real world can be compared with mental ones, independently of the senses through which the mental structures were constructed in the first place (e.g., von glasersfeld), or they embrace a phenomenological perspective that considers perception as the grouping of experiential complexes (e.g., mach).

all these approaches emphasize the primacy of the cognitive system (e.g., llinás) and its organizational closure (e.g., von foerster, maturana). hence, perceived patterns and regularities may be regarded as invariants of inborn cognitive operators (e.g., diettrich).

constructivist approaches can be said to differ also with respect to whether constructs are considered to populate the rational-linguistic (e.g., von glasersfeld, schmidt) or the biological-bodily (“enactivist/embodied” theories, e.g., varela)."
