understanding the influence of anthropogenic disturbance, and of variation in habitat quality, on organism condition, health and survival.
providing a mechanistic/functional understanding of the effect of anthropogenic environmental change on organisms; the use of physiological knowledge to develop mechanistic models for species distributions
evaluating stress responsiveness and environmental tolerances relative to environmental change (including global warming and ocean acidification).
understanding the adaptation of physiological processes to environmental variation (e.g. studies on thermal adaptation among populations).
understanding the optimal environmental conditions for ex-situ preservation of endangered species (captive breeding, seed bank protocols for storage and regeneration, tissue culture for plant species or genotypes that are difficult to regenerate from seeds).etc."

since it exceeds the means of researchers from individual scientific disciplines to investigate the simultaneous biopsychosocial changes of systems and how they jointly contribute to the social and adaptive functions of human individuals, a new scientific approach is necessary that links the various traditional scientific disciplines under a biopsychosocial approach to describe individual human development: developmental science.

developmental science combines concepts and insights from scientific disciplines which hitherto used to independently tackle the research of human and non-human development. as an interdisciplinary approach it examines individuals across the lifespan with the objective of comprehending the development of individuals with different cultural and ethnic as well as biological background, different economic and cognitive potentials and under diverse living conditions. to facilitate the understanding of developmental processes it is also necessary to overcome the disadvantageous separation of “normal” from “abnormal” human development. thus, the interdisciplinary field of developmental science comprises a holistic approach to understanding how different systems interact and influence development throughout life from genetic and physiological processes to social interactions and cultural processes."
